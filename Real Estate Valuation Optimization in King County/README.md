# Real Estate Valuation Optimization in King County

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning to predict real estate values in King County, including Seattle. By analyzing property sales data, we aim to develop a model that aids buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset encompasses property sales in King County from May 2014 to May 2015, featuring details like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and sale price among its 21 columns.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust machine learning model to predict house prices.
- Provide valuable insights to stakeholders for informed real estate decisions.

## Methodology
- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the relationships between house features and prices.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying significant predictors for the model.
- **Model Development**: Utilizing Random Forest Regression and evaluating its performance.

## Challenges and Insights
- Addressing outliers and the inherent variability in house prices.
- Importance of features like square footage and property grade on price predictions.

## Results
- The Random Forest model showed promising results but highlighted the need for further refinement.
- Model performance metrics indicated room for improvement in prediction accuracy.

## Future Directions
- Enhanced feature engineering and exploration of advanced modeling techniques.
- Incorporation of additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.

## Usage
To run the analysis, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed and execute the Jupyter Notebook provided.
