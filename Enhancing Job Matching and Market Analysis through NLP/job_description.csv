About us
Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

About us
Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
Life at Builder
It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted.

We aim at creating a work environment that allows you to do exceptional work, grow your skillset and, most importantly, be happy while doing it.
You may work on assignments anywhere in Belgium and neighboring countries like Luxembourg, France, the Netherlands, and the UK. You can expect to interact with IT/data specialists and business executives (marketing, process, customer care).
We believe that data is a means to an end and not an end in itself. We don’t use cutting-edge techniques when not suited to the problem we need to solve. We adapt to what the client truly needs, even if it might look less appealing from a technical perspective. For instance, we won't train a neural network predicting marketing performance based on 1000 variables if a simple dashboard showing marketing efficiency across a few dimensions answers the customer’s question. All our missions are about data, and so far, approximately 50% of them haven’t required any machine learning.
Salary and benefits
💰 Competitive remuneration package: We offer a competitive remuneration package,
Complete with a mobility budget, phone subscription, laptop, meal vouchers, etc.
There is also a variable remuneration component based on client satisfaction/ longevity and your contribution to our business development efforts.
A cafeteria plan in which you can allocate your variable remuneration to your preferred advantages (extra days off, electronics... and cash of course)
🏋️ Training roadmap: We will draft together a training roadmap, taking into consideration our internal competencies as well as your interests.
🤝 Supportive structure and transparency: What we don’t have in scale (yet), we’ll make it up with flexibility, support, and transparency. We will be there for you every step of the way, with individual coaching and career roadmapping.
🧰 Modern tools: Tools are a means to an end. We want them to help you do your best work, not become a bottleneck. That’s why you can expect up-to-date hardware and software tools so that you (hopefully) never have to swear at your computer.
🥂 Oh, and a little bit of fun too: We take our work very seriously, but we’re not afraid to laugh at ourselves. Life is too short.",,"Requirements

The Company
Vaticle is a team of people driven to empower engineers to solve complex problems. We are the creators of a polymorphic database, TypeDB, and its query language, TypeQL. TypeDB allows software engineers to solve object-relational mismatch entirely within the database, extend your data model continuously without refactoring or migrations, avoid data redundancy and ensure data consistency in real-time. From financial analytics to drug discovery, cyber threat detection to robotics disaster recovery, our technology empowers engineers around the world to tackle a higher order of complexity in data and knowledge.
We've built a pioneering developer community of 9,000+ engineers, spread over 20 countries, and counting. To continue pursuing this vision, we need to build a team of individuals who are not just the best and brightest in what they do, but also driven by a strong sense of purpose and compassion for the world.
The Role: Software Engineer (Senior)
As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be working on various products that make up our technology stack, which includes (but is not limited to):
TypeDB Core: is a polymorphic database with a conceptual data model, a strong subtyping system, a symbolic reasoning engine, and a beautiful and elegant type-theoretic language: TypeQL. TypeDB is built with open-source distributed technology stacks: SpeeDB, ANTLR, SCIP, Bazel, and GRPC. Today, TypeDB is written in Java, but we are in the process of rewriting it in Rust, with clients implemented in multiple languages, such as Java, Python, and Node.js. The extensive build system of TypeDB is built with Kotlin and Bazel.
TypeDB Enterprise: the distributed version of TypeDB, using the same open-source distributed technologies (plus ZeroMQ), built through a reactive architecture implementing the Raft replication algorithms. TypeDB Cluster serves as our commercial offering that provides TypeDB users with scalability, security, configurability and management tools to effectively use TypeDB in a production environment. Today, TypeDB Cluster is written in Java, but we're now rewriting it in Rust. The extensive build system is also built with Kotlin and Bazel.
TypeDB Cloud: the cloud platform in which TypeDB will be automatically deployed, managed, and orchestrated in any of the popular cloud services: GCP, AWS, or Azure. Similar to Vaticle Factory, Vaticle Cloud is built in the cloud, using the Kubernetes technology stack. Vaticle Cloud is also built in Rust, Angular, and TypeScript.
TypeDB Studio: the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of TypeDB.

About us
Innovation is fueled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
Life at Builder
It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

About us
Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
Life at Builder
It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.
Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild","Benefits
